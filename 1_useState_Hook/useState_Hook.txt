		*) Syntax of useState:

	- const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

		i)   state: The current value of the state.
		ii)  setState: A function used to update the state.
		iii) initialValue: The initial value of the state.



		Qn) How useState Works:

	- useState creates a piece of state and gives you two things:
			i)  The current value of the state.
			ii) A function to update the value.


		- Re-rendering:

	- When you call setState to update the state, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new state.
