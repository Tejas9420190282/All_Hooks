	- The useRef hookin React is like special box that can hold a value without causing your components to re-render whane the value changes. 
	  It's often used to access and interacts with DOM elements directly OR store a value that  persists between renders.


	
			Qn) What is useRef...?
	i) Storing a refrence of a DOM elements: ====> If you need to directly interact with DOM element, like focusing on an input field, 
							useRef gives you a way to access that element.

	ii) Storing mutuable values : ======> If you want to store a value that doesn't trigger a re-render when it changes (like a timer ID or a previous state), useRef is a great choice.
